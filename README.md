# Hi thereðŸ‘‹

I'm Rahmat Abdulfattah , a passionate Frontend Development graduate from **SheCodes.io** and **Stutern Academy**. 

Currently, I'm pursuing my dream as a full-stack development student at **Qwasar Silicon Valley**, continuously expanding my technical expertise.

As a dedicated Frontend Developer, I strive to create user-friendly and visually appealing web experiences that leave a lasting impact. I enjoy collaborating with teams to bring innovative ideas to life.

âš¡ Fun fact: I have a deep love for reciting and memorizing the Qur'an, which brings me both tranquility and purpose.
